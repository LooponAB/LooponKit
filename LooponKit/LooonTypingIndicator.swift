/// The TypingIndicator message acts as a notification that someone is currently typing a message. When your guest app
/// is sending a TypingIndicator, you don’t even need to include the typingIndicator field in the LooponEvent message.
///
/// Just keep sending a LooponEvent of type typingIndicator at around 5 second intervals, as long as the guest is still
/// typing a message.
///
/// When you receive a LooponEvent of type typingIndicator you should show a typing indicator, optionally together with
/// the authorName field to signal who at the hotel is typing a message. You should make the indicator automatically
/// disappear after timeout seconds, unless you receive a new typingIndicator LooponEvent before that in which case you
/// should reset the timeout to the new value - don’t add it!
