# LooponKit

## iOS Library for Loopon's Public API

This library contains models, connectors, and helper functions that allow an iOS App to easily communicate with Loopon's Public API.

[**Loopon's Public API Documentation**](https://api.loopon.com/public)

## Contents

* Model classes for API objects.
* LooponSocket: Helper class to connect to the Loopon Chat websocket.

## Examples

### LooponSocket

Your app's backend needs to communicate with Loopon's backend and request the registration of a Guest Stay. When that is performed successfully, you will receive a websocket URL to use with `LooponSocket`. This is represented by `LOOPON_WSS_URL`.

```swift
// This should ideally be a class property, as you only need a single instance.
let chatSocket = LooponSocket()
chatSocket.delegate = self
chatSocket.url = "wss://LOOPON_WSS_URL"

// MARK: Delegate methods:

/// Sent when the socket connects successfully.
func looponSocketDidOpen(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket)
{

}

/// Sent when the socket closes. If this was caused by an error or timeout, `didCloseCleanly` will be `false`, and
/// LooponSocket will automatically attempt to reopen the connection.
/// If this succeeds, another call to `looponSocketDidOpen:` will be made.
func looponSocket(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket, didCloseCleanly: Bool)
{

}

/// Sent when a message is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received chatMessage: LooponChatMessage)
{

}

```
