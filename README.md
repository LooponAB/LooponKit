# LooponKit

## iOS Library for Loopon's Public API

This library contains models, connectors, and helper functions that allow an iOS App to easily communicate with Loopon's Public API.

[**Loopon's Public API Documentation**](https://api.loopon.com/public)

## Contents

* Model classes for API objects.
* LooponSocket: Helper class to connect to the Loopon Chat websocket.

## Examples

### LooponSocket

Your app's backend needs to communicate with Loopon's backend and request the registration of a Guest Stay. When that is performed successfully, you will receive a websocket URL to use with `LooponSocket`. This is represented by `LOOPON_WSS_URL`.

```swift
func buildSocket()
{
	// This should ideally be a class property, as you only need a single instance.
	self.chatSocket = LooponSocket()
	self.chatSocket.delegate = self
	self.chatSocket.url = "wss://LOOPON_WSS_URL"
}

// MARK: Chat Socket Delegate methods:

/// Sent when the socket connects successfully.
func looponSocketDidOpen(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket)
{
	print("Socket opened!")
}

/// Sent when the socket closes. If this was caused by an error or timeout, `didCloseCleanly` will be `false`, and
/// LooponSocket will automatically attempt to reopen the connection.
/// If this succeeds, another call to `looponSocketDidOpen:` will be made.
func looponSocket(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket, didCloseCleanly: Bool)
{
	print("Socket closed!")
}

/// Sent when a message is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received chatMessage: LooponChatMessage)
{
	print("Got chat message from \(chatMessage.authorName): \(chatMessage.content ?? "")")
}

/// Sent when an error message is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received errorMessage: LooponErrorMessage)
{
	print("Socket got error: \(errorMessage)!")
}

/// Sent when a typing indicator is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received typingIndicator: LooponTypingIndicator)
{
	print("Socket got typing indicator: \(typingIndicator)!")
}

/// Sent when a runtime error happens.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, producedError error: Error)
{
	print("Socket got runtime error: \(error)!")
}

```

The difference between `looponSocket:receivedErrorMessage:` and `looponSocket:producedError:` is that the first is called when an error is sent from the server, and the second when an error is produced locally.
