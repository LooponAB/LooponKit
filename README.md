# LooponKit

## iOS Library for Loopon's Public API

This library contains models, connectors, and helper functions that allow an iOS App to easily communicate with Loopon's Public API.

[**Loopon's Public API Documentation**](https://api.loopon.com/public)

## Contents

* Model classes for API objects.
* LooponSocket: Helper class to connect to the Loopon Chat websocket.

## Examples

### LooponSocket

Your app's backend needs to communicate with Loopon's backend and request the registration of a Guest Stay. When that is performed successfully, you will receive a websocket URL to use with `LooponSocket`. This is represented by `LOOPON_WSS_URL`.

```swift
func buildSocket()
{
	// This should ideally be a class property, as you only need a single instance.
	self.chatSocket = LooponSocket()
	self.chatSocket.delegate = self
	self.chatSocket.url = "wss://LOOPON_WSS_URL"
}

// MARK: Chat Socket Delegate methods:

/// Sent when the socket connects successfully.
func looponSocketDidOpen(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket)
{
	print("Socket opened!")
}

/// Sent when the socket closes. If this was caused by an error or timeout, `didCloseCleanly` will be `false`, and
/// LooponSocket will automatically attempt to reopen the connection.
/// If this succeeds, another call to `looponSocketDidOpen:` will be made.
func looponSocket(_ looponSocket: LooponSocket, didCloseCleanly: Bool)
{
	print("Socket closed!")
}

/// Sent when a message is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received chatMessage: LooponChatMessage)
{
	print("Got chat message from \(chatMessage.authorName): \(chatMessage.content ?? "")")
}

/// Sent when an error message is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received errorMessage: LooponErrorMessage)
{
	print("Socket got error: \(errorMessage)!")
}

/// Sent when a typing indicator is received through the socket.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, received typingIndicator: LooponTypingIndicator)
{
	print("Socket got typing indicator: \(typingIndicator)!")
}

/// Sent when a runtime error happens.
func looponSocket(_ socket: LooponSocket, producedError error: Error)
{
	print("Socket got runtime error: \(error)!")
}

```

The difference between `looponSocket:receivedErrorMessage:` and `looponSocket:producedError:` is that the first is called when an error is sent from the server, and the second when an error is produced locally.

### Creating a Guest Stay

Your application should communicate with your backend, which in turn should talk to Loopon's backend t produce a guest stay (read more in the api documentation). After that is done, your application's backend should push the Guest Stay JSON object back to your app. The encoded JSON object as `Data` is represented by `guestStayJsonData` below:

```swift
func gotStay(_ guestStayJsonData: Data)
{
	do
	{
		self.guestStay = try JSONDecoder().decode(LooponGuestStay.self, from: guestStayJsonData)
	}
	catch
	{
		print("Error decoding guest stay JSON: \(error)")
	}
}
```

### Sending messages

To send a message from your app, create a `LooponChatMessage` object locally, and send it using `sendChatMessage:`:

```swift
func sendMessage(_ text: String)
{
	guard let sessionId = self.guestStay?.chatSession.sessionId else
	{
		print("There doesn't seem to be an initialized chat session.")
		return
	}

	let trimmedMessage = message.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
	let message = LooponChatMessage(content: trimmedMessage, type: .plainText, sessionId: sessionId)
	
	do
	{
		try self.chatSocket.send(chatMessage: message)
	}
	catch
	{
		print("Error sending chat message: \(error)")
	}
}
```

You should display the message as "pending" to the user, for now.

If and when the message is sent successfully, you will receive it back in the socket through the `looponSocket:receivedChatMessage:` delegate method. Only then you should "commit" the message in the UI, and store it locally if you are going to cache messages locally.
